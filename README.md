# Horse-Power Converter
Thank You for using the Horse-Power Converter! 
Have you ever wondered how many squirrels it would take to power your car, or how many squirrels it would take to launch a space shuttle?? Now there is an app for that.
You will have the ability to calculate these numbers.
This SPA(Single Page Application) uses a Rails API for the backend. (https://github.com/David-P-Molina/strange-conversion-calculator-backend)
