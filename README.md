# Strange Conversion Calculator
Thank You for using the Strange Conversion Calculator! 
Have you ever wondered how many squirrels it would take to power your car, or how many squirrels it would take to power a lightbulb? Now there is an app for that.
You will have the ability to calculate these numbers and submit your own units of measurement(to be approved by an admin.).
This SPA(Single Page Application) uses a Rails API for the backend. (https://github.com/David-P-Molina/strange-conversion-calculator-backend)
